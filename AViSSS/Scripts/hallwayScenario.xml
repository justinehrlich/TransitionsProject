Hallways are busy places and people will often bump into each other accidentally. Think about a more appropriate action and try again.</text_on_select>

                <text_on_select>You have made this person angry, you can tell by looking at the the expression on his face. He is upset because you lectured him.  Running in the hallway is usually against the rules but it is not your responsiblity to give orders to your peers.  Only adults or students with special responsibilities, such as hall monitors should give directions to students.  Your classmates may think you are bossy or arrogant if you tell them what to do.  Think about your appropriate action and try again. </text_on_select>

                <text_on_select>This is not the best choice, look at this persons face- his expression shows that you have made him feel sad. When someone apologizes to you, it is best to let him or her know you accept their apology so you don't hurt their feeling.  Think about your appropriate action and try again </text_on_select>
